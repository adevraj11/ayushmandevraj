<p class="text-justify">I spend less than 15 minutes on email every day - 15 minutes is absolutely insignificant compared to my total worktime. It was not always like this. A couple of weeks ago, I stumbled upon an interesting <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/one-touch-to-inbox-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="text-decoration:none">article</a> which underlined the philosophy - <i>the key to Inbox Zero is to touch each email only once</i> - and I was completely sold on that idea.</p>

<p class="text-justify">As someone who gets (on an average) 10-15 works emails, my inbox was always full and cluttered. At one point in time, I had more than 100 unread emails - which, given the person I am, was unimaginable. It was then I started looking out for a well designed and a simple system to solve my email woes./p>
