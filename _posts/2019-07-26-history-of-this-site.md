<p>A year ago, when I bought a domain for myself, little did I know that maintaining a website is an expensive affair. I not only had to pay for the domain name, but also for hosting and for WordPress. For the first year I paid 700 INR, thanks to a promo code in GoDaddy (which is my domain provider). It went smoothly for a year. I even got myself a cool email address associated with my domain name. I was extremely happy and thought I hit a jackpot. Until now.</p>

<p>Exactly fifteen days from today, I got an email saying my domain name is expiring soon and I need to renew it as soon as possible. I thought renewing it won’t cost much, probably more or less the same amount I paid for at the beginning. I happily logged into my GoDaddy account and as I pressed the renew now option, I was stunned. All I could see was I had to pay nearly 3000 INR to keep my website up and running for another year. Frankly speaking, I had zero clue that renewing my domain name would cost me so much! Upon digging in, I found out that renewing my domain name was not that pricy, just 600 INR for a year. The remaining amount was for that custom email address that I earlier mentioned, some money I had to pay monthly for WordPress and the remaining amount for hosting it. Even with my very limited knowledge I understood that it wasn’t a great deal.</p>

<p>Like any other netizen I went to Twitter and Reddit for help. Thankfully, one of my university seniors, who himself successfully runs a website, suggested on Twitter that I move to GitHub or Hugo where I can host for free. I have never heard about Hugo before. The only thing I knew about GitHub was Microsoft acquired it for some billion dollars a year ago. That’s all I knew. Thankfully, July being a month of vacations, I had abundant of free time to look up and read about the two. I watched several YouTube videos, read numerous articles and blog posts and acquainted myself with GitHub pages and Jekyll. Without any knowledge of coding whatsoever, I staretd building a website from the scratch. Tried and tested several themes (<a href="https://ayushmandevraj.github.io/jekyll-theme-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first theme</a>, <a href="https://ayushmandevraj.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second theme</a>) and finally when my confidence grew I started working on the current theme, and a week later was successful in setting up this website. Now, I do not pay a single paisa for hosting. I renewed my domain name for another two years by paying 1200 INR, which according to many on the internet is a pretty sweet deal.</p>
