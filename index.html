<h3 class="western">Who am I?</h3>
</div>

<p class="text-justify">In the immortal words of the existential philosopher, Popeye the Sailor Man - "I yam what I yam and that's all what I yam".\
Jokes aside, I'm an ardent politics buff, a frustrated lover of literature, tech geek, die-hard quizzer, Formula 1 fanatic, and a hard rock fan.</p> 

<h5 class="western"> <em>at present:</em></h5>

<p class="text-justify">I am an Assistant Professor of English at The Assam Royal Global University, Guwahati. I am also reading for a PhD in contemporary Russian-American literature at Gauhati University. Prior to this, I did my Master of Arts in English from Tezpur University.</p>
